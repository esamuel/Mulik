## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Team Player Count**: May show "0 players" even with players in room
   - **Cause**: Players array in teams not always populated
   - **Workaround**: Check Firebase console to verify data

2. **Turn Switching**: Not automatic
   - **Cause**: No automatic turn rotation implemented
   - **Workaround**: Manually end turn and start new one

3. **Local vs Firebase State**: Some desync possible
   - **Cause**: Two sources of truth (local store + Firebase)
   - **Solution**: Use Firebase as primary source (implemented)
